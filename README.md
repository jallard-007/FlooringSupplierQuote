# FlooringSupplierQuote

A flooring contractor needs a tool to help show customers options for costing materials.
Although all the floors are the same rectangular shape, the material type of the flooring (i.e.
concrete, hardwood, linoleum, ceramic tiles...) can change the way to calculate the required
amount. The contractor would like to be able to produce a table of estimated prices for several
different flooring materials for any customer-specified room size. Since many of the contractorâ€™s
customers are environmentalists, a waste ratio needs to be included with each quote.
This contractor uses the imperial system of measurement thus inches are used for all
calculations (but displays results with feet and inches). The quotes are based on the total
amount of material to buy at a price per square inch (that must be calculated for some
materials) plus a contractor markup. The materials fall into several distinct categories: poured
material (i.e. concrete, rubber), rolls of material (i.e. linoleum, carpeting), planks of material (i.e.
wood planks, composite planks), and square tiles (i.e. ceramic, porcelain). Certain sizes of
floors coupled with the type of material can create a lot of wasted material
